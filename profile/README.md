# HydroCouple
HydroCouple is a component-based modeling framework for simulating dynamics of complex water systems ranging from stormwater and combined-sewer sytems to large river, reservoir and lake systems. It operates on the principle of seperation of concerns where formulations for a process or a group of related processes are compiled into a single unit called a component. Disparate components can then be organized into a coupled model composition to represent a complex systems that is tailored to address the specific questions at hand. The benefit of this approach to model development is a move away the age old problem of fitting problems to avaiable models instead of letting the problems guide model selection.

HydroCouple is underpinned by an open interfacing standard that can be implemented by anyone for their own model. A marketplace of model components is also available for modelers to readily download for this applications. An SDK is provided to facilitate the model wrapping process. The HydroCoupleComposer graphical user interface facilitates interactive coupling of compliant models.
