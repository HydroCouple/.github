# HydroCouple
HydroCouple is a component-based model framework for modeling complex water systems ranging from stormwater and combined-sewer sytems to large river, reservoir and lake systems. It is comprised of an open interfacing standard that can be implemented by anyone for their own model. An SDK is provided to facilitate the model wrapping process. The HydroCoupleComposer graphical user interface facilitates interactive coupling of compliant models.
